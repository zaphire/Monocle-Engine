== Branches ==

"development" - the latest code
"master" - the last 'stable' code

i.e. If you want to check out the latest, grab "development."

== Building ==

To build Monocle, use one of the included project files.

If there is no project file for your platform, generate one automatically using Premake4.

See: http://industriousone.com/premake

Run: premake4 --help
to see all options.

Windows:
Generate Windows project files with Premake4.
e.g. To generate project files for vs2010, including tests
run: premake4 vs2010 --testapp
in the Monocle-Engine root directory.

The project files will show up in Build/gen-vs2010-All and Build/gen-vs2010-Monocle

To run tests on Windows, make sure the project's working directory is set to:
$(SolutionDir)..\..\..\Build\bin\

Mac OSX:
You can use the XCode project file included.
Make sure you're using XCode version 4 and that you have the shared Scheme selected.

Linux:
Generate makefiles with Premake4.
They will show up in Build/gen-*

Tests:
Change premake4 commandline to build a project file with tests included.

== Test Controls ==

Updated test controls coming soon...
